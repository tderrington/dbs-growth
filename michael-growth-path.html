  <div class="doc-meta">From Tim · February 2026</div>
</div>


<h2><span class="num">01</span> Where You Are</h2>

<p>You're currently doing project design, interiors, material selections, client presentations, and some of everything else because there's nobody else to carry the design side. You're the reason our projects feel like something — not just competent architecture, but spaces that have a point of view. That matters more than you probably realize, because it's the thing clients are actually buying from us.</p>

<p>What I see in you is not a technician. I can hire people who are better at detailing, better at specs, better at the granular production work. What I can't hire is someone who already understands what a DBS project should feel like — someone who can walk into a space we're designing and know immediately whether the material palette is right, whether the lighting is doing what it needs to do, whether the experience matches the ambition. You have that. It's the reason everything I'm about to describe is possible.</p>


<h2><span class="num">02</span> Where You're Headed</h2>

<p>Your path at DBS is toward leading the studio's design and interiors capability. This is the competitive moat of the practice. We design climbing centers, hospitality venues, experiential spaces — projects where <em>the interior is the product</em>. Most architecture firms subcontract interiors, which means the person making FF&amp;E decisions and the person making spatial decisions are in different offices with different priorities. We're building something different: an in-house interiors capability led by someone who understands the architecture, the client, and the experience as a single thing. That person is you.</p>

<p>The title at maturity is something like <strong>Senior Designer &amp; Interiors Lead</strong>. You'll take design direction from me, translate it into spatial and material reality, and manage the interiors team that executes it. The Experience &amp; Interiors Designer who joins in Phase 3 will report to you. You'll select that hire, mentor them, set the interiors design standards, and own the FF&amp;E, finish, and wayfinding decisions that define how people actually experience our work.</p>

<div class="callout green-c">
  <p><strong>The key shift:</strong> from doing all the design work to <em>leading</em> design outcomes. You move from producing every drawing and selection to setting the framework — the spatial concept, the material language, the experiential intent — and then directing a team that executes within that framework. The person reporting to you may be more technically proficient at FF&amp;E specifications or millwork detailing. Your value is knowing whether their selections are <em>right for this project</em>. That's design leadership.</p>
</div>

For a studio that designs experiential venues and hospitality spaces, this is the capability that differentiates us from every other 10-person firm. And you're the one building it.</div>

I set the design vision; you translate it into the material, spatial, and experiential reality that clients and their customers actually touch. The Experience &amp; Interiors Designer works under your direction. Project Designers across both teams look to you for the design language. You're not managing timelines or budgets — the Senior PAs and Studio Director own that. You're managing the quality of the experience.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

</div>


<h2><span class="num">04</span> What I Need From You</h2>

<p>Your design instincts are strong. What I'm asking you to develop is the ability to lead other people's design work — which is a different skill than doing your own. It means being able to articulate <em>why</em> a material choice is wrong, not just knowing that it is. It means giving direction that's specific enough to act on but open enough to let someone bring their own skill to it. It means building someone else up without doing their work for them.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The development areas all converge on one thing: translating intuition into leadership. You already know what's right. The work ahead is learning to help other people see it too — through words, through redlines, through the way you run a design review. Phase 2 is where this starts, when the Project Designer joins and you begin directing design work instead of producing all of it yourself.</p>


<h2><span class="num">05</span> Compensation Trajectory</h2>

<p>Compensation grows as the role deepens and the team grows around you. These ranges reflect Austin market rates for the responsibilities described.</p>

  </div>
</div>


<h2><span class="num">06</span> The Long Game</h2>

<p>There are two long-term paths, and they're both good.</p>

<p>The first is staying hands-on with design — becoming the person whose eye defines what a DBS project is. That's not a stepping stone; it's a career. Some of the most valuable people in the best firms never manage a budget or run a meeting. They're the reason the work is good. If that's what you want, it's a path I'd be proud to support.</p>

<p>The second is growing into broader authority — something like a Senior Associate or Associate Principal role. In that version, you're co-leading client relationships alongside me, particularly for interiors-heavy projects where the client conversation is really about experience, not structure. You'd be the person a hospitality client calls when they want to talk about what their space should feel like. That's a relationship-driven role, and it requires comfort with the business side of the work — proposals, scope, fees. It's a different muscle, and we can build it together if you're interested.</p>

<p>Neither path requires the other. Neither path is more valuable to the studio than the other. What matters is that we name them now, so the trajectory is yours to choose rather than something that happens to you by default.</p>

<p>The immediate thing I want you to take away: we're building an interiors capability that will be the competitive advantage of this studio. You're the person I'm betting on to lead it. Everything between now and that moment is preparation.</p>


<div class="footer-note">
  This is a living document. The timeline depends on revenue, and phases are triggered by work in hand — not by the calendar. Compensation ranges are directional, not commitments, and will be formalized as roles are reached. What won't change is the trajectory: your path here is toward leading the design and interiors capability of this studio. — Tim
